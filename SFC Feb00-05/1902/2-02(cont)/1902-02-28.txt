say that It is none of his controversy, as

ROOSEVELT IGNORES DISCOURTESY
"I know nothing whatever about It,"
said Herrin. "I cannot have any knowl
edge In such matters until the suit Is
brought. Of course. If some one wants
to sue the railroad company, when that
is done it will be my business to defend,
but I can't anticipate any such action.
"Why, no; I don't consider that there is
any monopoly In the manner in which the
telegraph service and the railroads are
conducted. It would be Impossible to give
the same concessions to two companies.*'
William F. Herrin, attorney for the
Southern Pacific, who is in Los Angeles
from San FYandsco, professed . absolute
ignorance of the matter.
pany Is back of the suits he answered:
"I am acting- for the Attorney General.
It would be unprofessional to make public
the business of my client, in this case as
In any other, and as much as I might like
to discuss the subject, at this time I can
not. If the Attorney General's office
would give out the first information my

I Anderson says that they had trouble at
first 'In get tins: close to the mules, finally,
however, they lassoed, qoÂ© of the animals
and separated" lffrom the "others. Tbe
mule started kicking like a broncho, and
in a moment the boy had fallen off with
the end or the lasso still wrapped around
his body and the other endl on the mule's
neck. The terror-stricken animal' dashed
down the rocky hillside toward a stable a
half-mile away. The boy was pulled off
his feet and dragged along from bowlder
to bowlder, striking each stone with ter
rific force. The mule continued his mad
gallop to the stable door. The boy was
lifeless when picked up a few moments
later. Â¦ His neck was broken.

SANTA BARBARA, Feb. 27.â The step
from a fiddler to a millionaire is a rather
long one, but Dame Fortune dispenses
her favors in a rather eccentric fashion
at times, and M. J. Lewis of* Santa Bar
bara, familiarly known as "Lewis the
Fiddler," seems to be. in a fair way, to re
ceive a fortune up in the millions irie a
very short time. - Â¦Â».: - .
Many years ago Leonard Case -went to
Ohio and settled on land which is now
the heart' of the city of Cleveland. â¢ At
that 'time the land was not considered
valuable, but is now estimated to be
worth in the neighborhood of ttO.000.000.
Case died fifteen years ago, a bachelor,
and the lawyers have been since hunting
up the heirs.
Lewis' mother was a niece of the dead
millionaire, and as she is now deceased
Lewis will ' come In for her share of the
property. Another heir Is Samuel Eddy,
now. living at Los Olivos, in Santa Bar
bara County. Lewis received a letter from
a lawyer yesterday, stating that he was
about to leave for Santa- Barbara, and
undoubtedly will soon arrive, when the
exact amount coming to each of the
heirs-at-law will.be known. Â¦'
Lewis was born in Plymouth, . Pa..' 'in
1855, moved to California m 1870. and after
wandering? around from place to place, hla
travels taking him to- nearly every city
of any ' importance from Washington to
Mexico, he finally settled in Santa Bar
bara in 1S90, where he has since resided.
While here he earned hiÂ» livelihood by his
violin, playing for dances, and supple
mented this by driving tourists about the
city. . He is a member of the city Fire
Department. 'Â¦Â¦'â¢; â¢ â¢ _ -
Lewis lives alone in a modest little
adobe - building, near the fire house, and
takes his good fortune in a very matter
of-fact . way. He said, when asked if he
had had any- expectations of inheriting
this fortune: "I have, ot course, known
of this wealthy relative of mine for a
great many years and have often heard
my father speak of him, but never
dreamed of getting a part of his estate.
In fact, I supposed he was married and
had heirs of his own.". :

Miss Stone Unable to Shed
CONSTANTINOPLE. Feb. 27.â It is un

lake steps to obtain a reimbursement of
the sum ($72,000) paid to the -brigands as
a ransom for Miss Ellen M. Stone and
Madame Tsilka, holding Turkey, responsi
ble, inasmuch as the capture of the mis
sionaries was effected on Turkish soiL
This question of responsibility may have
serious developments, since Turkey em
phatically disclaims responsibility and
lays the blame on Bulgaria.
SALONICA. Feb. 27.â Miss Stone's evi
dence Is not likely to prove of much value
in, fixing the responsibility for an ln
uemiiity from Turkey or Bulgaria, since
she is not aware whether she even crossed
the boundary, owing to being blindfolded
and the night marching tactics of the bri
ganis. Soldiers are now pursuing the
band, but the brigands have a long: start.
Miss Stone already has received num
erous liberal offers, one of them being
from an American magazine, which of
fered her $35,000 and a royalty for six ar
ticles. *

Department has received a request from
New York for the privilege of depositing

with the privilege of withdrawing It at
San Francisco, presumably, for shipment
to the Orient. The request also says that
probably J14.000.000 will be required before
the middle of March. As this transaction
is of advantage to the Government, the
department having an excess of gold in
San Francisco, the request has been
granted.
OAKLAND, Feb. 27.â F. A. Leach. Su
perintendent of the San Francisco Mint,
said to-night:
"I have no knowledge of the proposed
transfer and do not know what It Is for.
There is now eighty millions of dollars in
the San Francisco Mint, more than there
ever was In the history of the place, and
it would be a. gtxxJ thing to get rid of
some of it. Two millions or even fourteen
millions would not be missed, and it
would be a relief to the mint to get some
of the coin away."

detectives in the pay of the prosecution.
John E. Raker, one of the counsel for
the defense, made the folio wing' statement
regarding the outcome of the trial : . .
ThJ verdict is satisfactory and from ex
pressions we have heard to-day we feel con-'
vlnced it meets with the approval of the resi
dents of Modoc County. One fact has been
demonstrated, that Jlodoc . County jurors are
not to be Intimidated Into a verdict by im
ported gun fighters and detectives and without
evidence. ; It takes evidence and a fair trial
to got a verdict at their hands. . The trial has
been outrageously unfair in every particular
faklntf a truthful record of the trial, including
the language from the bench to the counsel for
the defense, the conduct of the counsel for the
prosecution and \ the treatment of the counsel
for the defense by the court, it has been one of
the most remarkable and disgraceful trials In
the civilized world.: The evidence on the part
of the prosecution has been a monstrous fail
ure all â¢ the way through. â¢ Â¦Â¦. â¢ .
View of General Post.
Assistant Attorney ; General Post holds
a somewhat different view, from that en
tertained by Raker.- , General Post said: â¢
"The evidence for the prosecution estab

riage of justice In- the case lies with the'
people of Modoc County.'.'
Beason for the Delay.
Two ballots were taken' before the jury
agreed to acquit Brown. Or. - the - flrst
ballot one juror held -out -for conviction
and another put in a blank vote. ..On the
second ballot the jury agreed to acquit
Brown of the murder of Martin Wilson.
The jury 'is said to have come to a con
clusion before midnight, but held off un
til after midnight so that an extra' day'a
pay would be f orthcoming. Â¦ - It t was mu
tually agreed to have the Courthouse bell
tolled aoout 2:40, o'clock. ' r.v , .,-
One of the jurors expressed himself as
having' voted to acquit Brown "because
he did not believe In Modoc County, being
run >by people from, down below," iwhich
is onlyanother way of saying the people
of Modoc County do not . approve , of the
Attorney General's representative pros-'
ecuting criminals of Modoc County.'. An;
other Juror voted ; to acquit Brown on ac
count, of certain contradictions of th&
confessions ,of -Hutton Â¦ and -Morris,^ and
stiir another of the "twelve ! good men : and
true" voted â¢ to acquit -Brown' because f of â¢
When the court asked "Gentlemen, have
you arrived at a verdict," Harry Wilder,
who had' been selected. as foreman, by his
fellow jurors, advanced to the bench and
handed , to . the court- the -slip- of paper
which meant so much for Brown. -, judge
Harrington â¢ examined the â¢ document 'and
haridea it. to Clerk Smith, instructing' him
to tile it with the records of the court, and
to enter the verdict upon - the ' minutes.
-This -cone, Smith read the verdict, and
when he came to that part which declared
Brown "not guilty" a huzza went up in
the courtroom. Â¦ . Â¦ â¢ Â¦ . â¢
Brown half-smiled, as did his wife, ' and
Mrs. Leventon . could Â¦ not ' repress her
tears, but it was evident that .she was
crying- from joy. John E. Raker did his
best to Iook unconcerned, but his inner
most â¢ feelings could : not be--entirely-sup
pressed ana his face gradually. broke into
a smile. - .- x , ., -V Â« - ,
In 'dismissing the Jury, Judge Harring
ton thanked tnem for, their attention to
the case. Brown was committed to the
care ot the Sheriff to await trial for the
murder of Calvin * Hall. After the ad
journment the defense and their friends
made merry for a short time. Brown per
sonally thanked the jury for the verdict
and tnere was general handshaking all
around. . â¢ - . . .:Â¦]Â¦Â¦
In spite of the early hour the news that
the jury had brought in a verdict spread
like wiidttre. Doors were opened and
windows were raised by people clad in
their night robes, desirous of n earing the
verdict. ; â¢ .' ..
Reading of the Verdict.
three-score people who gathered in the
courtroom spent their time studying the
faces of the jurors with a view of ob
taining from the expressions .of their
countenances an inklingÂ»of what the ver
dict was. When Defendant ' Brown, ac
companied by his brave little w'ife and
sweet-faced girl, and Mrs. -Robert Leven
ton, wife of one of the - accused, and
Brown's sister, entered the courtroom* all
eyes were riveted upon the party. The
care-worn face of Mrs. Brown, on which
was so plainly depicted the ordeal through
which she had passed during the closing
argument, looked brighter, â¢ and the little
daughter wore a smile of- expectancy.
Mrs. Leventon was crying. -
The verdict was rendered this morning
â¢ at 3:40 o'clock, after less than five hours'
'deliberation, the fate of Brown having
been submitted to the Jury at 11. o'clock
.last night. At 2:40 o'clock the Courthouse
I bell tolled and immediately the anxious
Â¦watchers for the verdict began to wend
their way toward the Courthouse. Judge
Harrington -was sent for and messengers
â¢were dispatched for the counsel of the
prosecution and the defense.
Judge Harrington took his accustomed
seat on the bench and pending the ar

costume to the place where the eulogy,
was to be delivered. . . '..V - . .; ;
â¢That" was the extent -of the-outward
spectacle.' For the people,', the event' was
one . for :the mind â¢ and heart.V rather : than
for the. eye and ear.; But notwithstanding
the : fact proclaimed 'in * advance that adf
mission to the Hall of Representatives,
and even to the Capitol itself, was to
be restricted to those holding cards, the (
people congregated in â¢ unnumbered thou
sands about the great marble pile . upon
the: hill. While the ticket-holders-be
sieged the great bronze, doors to the En
trance of the rotunda and overflowed^ the
portico, .and . steps leading --^to'. it, -'the
crowds were kept back by lines of.^blue
coated police 'walled on three sides of the
broad plaza* in front of the Capitol. The
only emblem of mourning at the Capitol
was the flags fluttering, at half-mast
above the two "wings and on the great
arching dome. 'The . precedent of- the
Garfleld memorial exercises was followed
closely. The hall was, without decoration
of any character. The red-coated marine
band, sixty strong, was stationed in the
corridor, which separated the hall from
the rear lobby.of the House.. :
At 10 o'clock the doors were opened and
in five minutes the spacious galleries sur
rounding the chamber were dense with
black rows of --people. Even .the â¢ aisles ;
were filled, but 'the' Crowding 'and jam
ming which have marred so. many state
occasions, to-day was averted, .as the
tickets issued were limited strictly to the
number of seats provided. Only one was
given to each Senator and Representative;
and the gathering in the galleries was a
most distinguished one. The^ fact .that
few of the ladies wore bright gowns was
especially noticeable. They had attired
themselves in dark costumes, befitting the
occasion, and their white faces "were ren
dered .distinct by. the somberness of their
apparel. Gradually** the " members of Â¦ the;
House strolled in and took their places.
The big, cumbrous revolving chairs at
the desks had been removed and smaller
ones substituted, in order to increase the
seating capacity on the floor. .In the area
in front of the Speaker's rostrum heavy_
leathered upholstered fauteils. had.,., been
placed for the accommodation of the
President, Prince Henry, the Cabinet, , the
general of the army and Justices of the
Supreme Court. The first â¢ two . rows on
the Democratic ' side were reserved for
the diplomatic corps and the' four rows
immediately behind them for ths members
of the Senate. The Governors of the
States. Commissioners of the District of
Columbia, the judiciary. - of {he '. district,
the heads of the departments and other
invited guests were to sit back of the
Senators. . .
Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Roosevelt, Mrs.
Cowles, the President's sister, and Mrs.
Carew, the President's sister-in-law, -and
friends of the President, occupied the ex
ecutive gallery.-.. ..Â¦ Â¦' s
At 11:40, as the strains of the intermezzo
from "Cavalleria Rusticana" .floated
through the hally there was . a stir
throughout- the- chamber. ' The doors ". to
the right of the Speaker's rostrum were;
flung wide and' the members of the diplo
matic corps marched in, preceded by the
sergeant-at-arms of the House. The for
eign Embassadors and Ministers did not
appear in their court costumes, but in
somber fjgock coats, befitting the occasion,
with tb^exception of the Chinese-Minis
ter, who was attired in his rich costume
of silk, is â¢. :i
Lord Pauncefote, the British Embassa

Signor Mayo Desplanenes of Italy, and

r Just! beyond the bronze rail that sepa

v As the hands of the: clock .opposite the
Speaker's rostrum pointed to noon Speak
er Henderson called the assemblage to or
der. He was dressed in a black frock coat,
the somberness of .which was relieved *by.
a flower in the lapel. .The vast audience
immediately : responded to his signal and
arose to the brief i prayer of the chaplain.
Then followed the usual ' routine Â¦Â¦ of the
bpening-of' a*sesslon of the House. .The
journal of Wednesday's proceedings was
read by the clerk in the customary dron-r
ing fashion. By Â¦- the . Speaker's ; direction
the ; clerk read the joint resolution provid
ing for the memorial services and- the or
der of the proceedings. Hardly. had the
reading been concluded "and the journal
approved before the doorkeeper announced
the Â¦ arrival of the Senate. The Speaker
tapped three- times with his gavel. *, -,
Soon -â¢ afterward the- doorkeeper - an
nounced the general of- the army. . The
Speaker tapped three times, the members
of the House and the ' diplomatic body
arose - and General .. Miles, .'.- resplendent in
gold ; lace, gold ; epaulettes and : a .'. broad
yello-w ' sash - across Â». his - breast l and "with
his sidearms clanging heavily at his heels,
led .the way down .the main aisle. Ad
miral Dewey, who .is; in; Florida, Â¦ would
have been with him had < he been in the
city, but as it>was the lieutenant general
of the army, alone and unattended, made
his way to his place at the extreme right
of the chairs reserved for. members of the
Supreme Court.. - :â¢ ' Â¦ .
Tap, tap, , tap, ' and once more the as
semblage arose. Â¦ The door swung open
and on the threshold, with.- every eye upon
him, stood Prince Henry, between Sen
ator Foraker and General Grosvenor,
chairmen, respectively, of the Senate and
House committees. â¢: . ; <
"His; Royal Highnes's, Prince Henry of
Prussia,'.' announced the doorkeeper.
â¢ The Prince was dressed in the â¢ simple
uniform of an admiral of the German
navy, without a jingle star or other evi
dencg of the imperial house to which he
belongs. He carried white gloves and hia
flat naval cap in his left hand. Â¦ At his
side hung a short gold scabbard. Slender,
but tall.and commanding looking, he tow
ered 'above those at his' side. He came
forwards with . easy, graceful bearing, es
corted by Senator Foraker and General
Grosvenor, and- took the - place assigned
for him, next to that reserved for the
President. At the same time the members
of his suite, in their showy uniforms/who
had followed him into the hall, were ush
ered into the seats directly in the rear of
those Â¦ reserved . f or members of the Sen
ate. ". The Â¦ Prince - wore Â¦Â¦ a band Â¦ of [ mourn
ing upon,, his "-.left arm. This was not,
however, in honor of the occasion, but
was the badge of mourning still worn by
the members of the 1 German imperial
family for his dead mother, the Dowager
Empress of Germany. â¢ Â¦
"Hail* to -the' Chief.!'.
As soon as all had again been" seated
the Speaker's gavel once more brought
the assemblage to its feet; and the mem-

: Throughout the delivery of the speech
the audience listened with great interest,
but the peroration coupling together as if
fo> all time the names of "Washington and
Lincoln and- McKinley .seemed especially
t6 â¢ impress the hearers, and as Secretary
Hay uttered , the last solemn words, the
spectators broke into a perfect'storm of
applause, which lasted for seyeral mln-'
utes. -The President ; himself seemed as
deeply impressed as. those about him, and
tfoth he â¢ and the members of the Cabinet
were quite as. enthusiastic as the remain
der of the audience. The benediction was
offered by the Rev. Dr. Milburn. and to

the House ' to ' order -and" Payne of New

The French bark Francoise d'Ambolse,
which left here February' 10 for Queens
town, returned, to port. yesterday, in tow
of the tug Relief. Six days out of port
the bark encountered some terrific weath
er'in the shape of a southeasterly c-ale
which turned into a northwester of hurri
cane; ferocity. Sails were blown awav
boats were smashed and the rudder head*
was/broken about two, feet below the
water line. When the storm abated about
100. tons of .wheat were moved forward to
allow the rigging of temporary steering
gear. While better than nothing, the im
provised rudder fchains were impracticable
for a long voyage, so the d'Amboise wal
lowed about until she sighted the Solace
The Solace reported her and the Relief
went out after her and brought her to
port.

The advantages of the central and northern 1 sections
of the State, ought therefore to ;'; be j brought jout
strongly.at the Stl Louis exposition. They should
be given an equal prominence to those of the south,
and to that end San Francisco should co-operate
with'* the people of the interior and act as energeti
cally, as Los.Anceleo is acting on behalf of the section
"At, the "present time the southern -counties, swarm
with tourists. AH the great, winter resort hotels are
crowded to the limit, and ; there have 'Â¦' been times
when some of the" principal hotels have had to turn
away as many as a hundred; applicants in. a single
day. Of these crowds of seekers after winter sun
shine, comparatively, few will"see the central or north
ern parts of the State. They will not even v think of
visiting those sections because they, have: heard little
about them and know nothing -of their attractive
ness for holiday pleasure-seekers as well , as for set
tlers and for capitalists looking for investments. '
ONE of tlie pressing needs, of the time is that
of providing for a .suitable exhibition of the
j resources and industries of California at the
St. Louis exposition. 'To the accomplishment of
that need San Francisco should contribute liberally
and promptly. \ In a special" degree should she con
tribute to the promotion of movements for good ex
hibits from Central and Northern California,, since
Los Angeles, the metropolis of the South, will give
her aid exclusively to the south, San" Francisco has
of course the wliole State to: look after, but in doing
so she should not overlook the fact' that certain sec
tions need help more than others.
SAN FRANCISCO AND THE STATE.
It has been noted that for many years past almost
every man who attains cabinet rank finds a good po
sition waiting him when he retires. Instance after
instance could be cited of men who have left the Cab
inet to enter at once upon lucrative positions of trust,
and the Boston Globe finds the thing so common
that it says: "One way to get a $50,000 job in New
York is first to get an $8000 job in the Cabinet at
Â£, Washington." Â¦ It remains as true as ever' that there
is no money in politics, but it seems there is a good
deal of it waiting for the. right man when he comes
out. â¢

.tested before it is shipped to its
owner, the Calumet and Hecla Mining
Company of Michigan.
Its height, or diameter rather, is sixty
five feet, and. with its supports it weighs
more than 1,000,000 pounds. It is to be used
to carry away the refuse from . stamp

If any one can beat that he is invited to try. As is
well known, the Kaiser never loses an opportunity
to tell his people that their empire rests upon his
army and his generals; that they stand guard over
the German tribes and protect their federation from
all -foes who offer! When he gives the newspaper
men of the United States rank equal to his generals
it is saying that this country rests upon the press in
the same sense as his rests upon the army. Men and
brethren, let us sit up and notice things. We are by
ro means the ntesters of compliment and the pur
veyors of politeness that we thought we' were. The
Kaiser shows himself an artist in that line, and his
brother is a fine representative of his skill.. Of
course newspaper men knew their position before
this was said, but they were too modest to tell it,
and were rot aware that it had got out. Â¦ To be fair
about it, the newspaper genius of the United States
has been greatly enriched, stimulated and developed
in all its best features by the countrymen of the
Prince. Dr. Oswald Ottendbrfer, \ Carl SchurzV
Hesing sr.d Emil Pretorius have given to American
journalism some of its best impulses and highest
traditions. This is.stid not with any purpose of
swapping compliments with Prince Henry, but is^he,
utterance of a fact. Journalism in this country owes'
its best features to the freedom of our institutions,
and 'it may not be ungracious or amiss to say that
freer journalism in the empire of the Kaiser might
finally shift Â¦; the maintenance of the empire from a
costly and dependent army to the keeping of an in
dependent press.
THE press banquet to the Prince of Prussia in
New York seems to have been the most so
ciable function in which the visitor has yet
tiken part. His own easy adaptation to the scene
stands in rather favorable contrast to the somewhat
stilted attitude of other participants. It. is evident
that the young sailor' will never miss a trick. Stand
ing in the presence of newspaper men, he managed
his compliments to the profession as :easily as he
probably could handle a gun on the deck of his flag
ship. He told the scribes who sat with him that his
brother, the Kaiser, had said to him: "You will
meet many members of the press, and I wish you
therefore to keep in mind that in the United States
thc\- rank almost with my generals in command."
THE PRINCE AND THE PRESS.
The curious thing about the situation is that there
is no partisan issue in the matter; there is no evident
difference of opinion" concerning it; the press of both
parties and of all sections favors the plan'; it has been
iiecommended repeatedly by Secretaries of the Treas
ury, but in some way every bill to bring about the re
form gets shelved. It remains to be seen what will
happen to the two new before the House. One or
the other of them should be enacted, and it is to be
hoped the business interests of the country will be
sufficiently active to bring it, about. â¢
It is estimated that at present the Government has
in the treasury vaults and lying idle something like
$150,000,000 which could be returned to the channels
of trade without inconveniencing the treasury ' in
making its payments. That sum of course ought to
be in use and in circulation.
' Two bills are now before the House dealing with
the subject. 'One of them, by Mr. Sulzer of New
York, directs the "Secretary of the Treasury to de
posit all. surplus funds belonging to the United States
Government with, national banks having a capital' of
not less than $500,000 and a surplus of not less than
$500,000, and provides:?; "That such deposits be made
without requiring fLTiiited States: Government bonds
as security, that on, ; such' deposits the United States
treasury receive interest at the rate of 2. per 'cent per
annum, and that such deposits shall be a first lien on
the assets of the bank." i â¢Â¦ <
The other bill, introduced by Mr.' Pugsley, who is
himself president : ofa bank'and is a member of the
Committee on Banking and Currency, is similar to
that of Mr. Sulzer, differing from it mainly in that
it leaves the depositing of the surplus money to the
discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury instead
of making it compulsory. The two bills agree in
authorizing the deposit. of the Government money
without requiring the security of bonds, but upon
the payment of interest.
Several Secretaries of the Treasury have urged
the adoption of some such measure. The main thing ;
pf course is to get the large suni of money now
locked up in the treasury into general circulation,
but it is also desirable that the Government get a
profit on it. It will be remembered that some months
ago Secretary Gage estimated that if the Govern
ment funds in excess of $50,000,000, which sum should
be kept in the; treasury as working capital, had been
placed on deposit at 2 per cent, the interest during a
period of not so many years back would have given
the Government an income , of $32,000,000, and besides
would have furnished money for enterprises that
would have materially advanced the prosperity.
FOR a long time there has been more or less dis
cussion concerning the. best means of getting
the surplus money in the United States treasury
back 'into the channels of trade so. as to prevent any
thing like a restricti'ori of the money market. It has
been the custom to achieve that end at times by de
positing, the; money .without with the larger
banks of the country upon security of United States
bonds. The' plan has been 'effective, but it 'has not
been satisfactory. â¢ Periodically there have been com-,
plaints of favoritism "on the. parubf the- Government
in making the deposits, .and sometimes the com
plaints have been carried to the. extent of angry and
ugly charges against the administration. It is to. the
credit of the treasury jhat not a single one of the.
charges has ever been substantiated, but none the
less it has long been recognized that the custom of
making deposits of Government money without in
terest should- be stopped, and that where such de
posits are made 1 the bankers' should be required to
pay current interest rates just as they pay upon other
deposits. .
GOVERNMENT DEPOSITS.
There has been a large amount of eloquent talk on
the rapidity with which Japan has advanced herself
to the rank of a civilized nation, but inasmuch as it
appears there is noU single millionaire in the king
dom,- it -seems the talk has been ill-founded. In
these, days j civilization without' millionaires seems
like a contradiction of terms.' , â¢
These are the parts of the problem of such vital
interest that there will be no contentment nor sense
of safety until they are settled in accord with public
interests. : There must â¢ be , some safe . . substitute
somewhere for the watchfulness of rivalry and self
interest when these are merged and lost in combina
tion. Just what this substitute is to be must be a fu
ture development. At the first view it seems that it
will be found in the publicity which the President*in
sists shall be ma\le the first statutory duty of com
binations. Surely publicity will be a great part if it
be not the whole of the substitute for the watchful-
â¢; It must necessarily figure in the very front of the
discussion.- The people may admit ,the economy of
combination. They may assent willingly to the in
crease in railroad pi ofits resulting from that ..eco
nomy. They may easily see the. commercial benefit
of stability in rates. They may omit to discuss any
of these phases of the subject and accept them con
tentedly as settled in line with interests which the
shippers and the roads have in common. But they
will not be content to leave it in the power of a
combination of parallel roads, with the same ter
minals and often with the same interrhediate stations,
to so manipulate rates and rebates as to effect a
transfer of settled industries, destroy the value of real
estate in one town and inflate it. in another, and
build the fortunes of a few individuals at the expense
of the many. .
The people have become keenly" intelligent and
keenly alive in this mutter. Where competing roads
may merge, receive a common administration , and
have a common policy, it is obvious that this safe
guard is withdrawn. The keen eye of rivalry will be
closed. The only # known means for detecting dis
crimination will disappear and be no longer at the
service of the shipper. It is true that Mr. Hill, presi
dent of the Northern Securities Company, which rep
resents jhe merger that is now in contention, has
given the assurance that the combination will not
raise rates'. But that is not the question at all. The
people do not fear increased rates as much as they
i fear rebates and discriminating rates/ Mr.' Hill may
not have had this phase of the question in mind, or
he may have thought of it and not have cared to
mention it. - ' ; 7 it
The most odious use of the power of transporta
tion corporations heretofore has been their power to
grant rebates and special privileges to individuals- and
localities. A road decides that a specified- industry
may be carried on here and not there, and its dis
criminating rate absolutely -. forces the flourishing of
such industry in one locality and destroys it in an
other. In like manner a discriminating rate makes
the business of one man profitable and destroys that
of another. While roads are competing they detect
these offenses in their rivals. The complaints of re
bates and discriminations filed with, the Interstate
Commerce Commission, as a rule, are made by
lailroads against their competitors. / â¢
The action in the Federal courts ordered by Presi
dent Roosevelt raises this Federal . issue. If the
courts do not find law enough in existence it- will
be the plain duty of Congress to enact it; The. im
mediate effect of the . President's order has been to
arrest other industrial combinations that were under
way. This is in itself a good thing. The people'
want time to breathe and look'about them, and. study,
the ultimate effect of these combinations. Admitting
that therc'is a natural law^'that leads surely through
competition to combination, the people want to know
whether; the instability and losses of competition, its
non-beneficial effects, can be remedied by combina
tion without at the same time removing some of the
safeguards of competition which are absolutely essen
tial to the individual and industrial life of the
country. .
' The court has held heretofore that a State may
control common carriers and transportation corpora
tions within its own jurisdiction only, and not.fur
ther. Under these decisions a State may prevent a
change in the line of a railway that has received right
of way and put service on. a line on which towns and
shipping points have been established, and to which
productive and mercantile 'conditions have; been ad-
justed. A State may regulate, judicially, rates of
freight and fare on all traffic in its own borders, and'
not beyond, and it may also, by parity of reasoning,
prevent the application of a merger of lines to the
rates on business transacted within its jurisdiction.
But beyond this a State cannot go. The. further is
sue is Federal. %
. 1- S the readers of. The' Call were led to antici-
ZA pate by our- forecast, the-Supreme Court has
| *Â¦} â¢*Â¦ decided . it has. no : jurisdiction to project the
anti-merger law of Minnesota beyond the borders of
that State and make it the supreme law of the land.
This decision seemed to us inevitable because of the
interstate and therefore the Federal nature of the
issue presented. ', : .
The St. -Louis! exposition .is going to afford , the
best .field for advertising California that the imme
diate future offers. Every section of the State should
be represented there at its best, in generous rivalry
each vying [with: another": to see which can most fully
show forth the marvelous wealth of the domain of
California. In that rivalry San Francisco should
take part as leader, helper and director. The city is
in competition with no . section. Its welfare is de
pendent Â¦ upon the welfare of all. It can have no
other self-interest than that of promoting the inter
ests of all. Its jhelp just now, however, is most
needed by, the central and the northern portions of
the State, 'and in that direction the help should; be
given. The issue is. not one to be set aside. It is a
genuine duty .which"; the city owes to the interior as
well as to her own best interests. It should there
fore be attended to at once.
to which she stands -in : , the- relation of' financial
metropolis : and commercial capital.
..' It is of little- profit to repeat over and over
in a general .way.; that Northern and Central Califor-'
nia are rich in resources, fertile of soil,. beautiful in
landscape and blessed ' with an unsurpassed climate.

Mr. Fillmore remained in retirement un
til his services were sought by President
John . Martin of the North Shore
Railway, which was then under process
of reorganization. He took the offer un
der advisement and finally accepted it
with the proviso that the salary be suit
able. He was told to fix his own com
pensation and on January 23 of the pres
ent year his appointment as general man
ager of tWe road was announced. Mr.

request his resignation was handed in on
July 10, 1901. The announcement that he
had been superseded by J. M. Herbert
was a complete surprise to the public.
There could be no question as to Mr. Fill
more's ability as a railroad man, and be
was universally conceded to' be the peer
of any manager in the United States.
Why President Hays sought his removal
has never been explained, but it was said
that Fillmore's first appearance did not
impress the new president favorably.
Hays thought that a railroad manager
should be a quick-moving', nervous man,
while Mr. Flilmore was the opposite,
heavy in build, slow of movement and
deliberate in every action. It was stated
at the time the resignation was tendered
that there had been an agreement where
by Mr. Fillmore would receive J50U month
ly until a new position was opened for
him, but this allowance was never paid.
JEROME. A. FILLMORE, one of the
best known and most respected
and beloved railroad men of the
West, died at 7 o'clock yesterday
morning at his home, 2004 Gough
street. His Illness was brief. Only last
Tuesday he was downtown giving his at
tention to Important matters connected,
with the. North Shore Railroad.. but that
afternoon he was forced to go to bed,
and Wednesday morning his condition
was found to be serious. Pneumonia set
in and he grew steadily worse, losing con
sciousness, which he never regained,
Wednesday at 3 p. m.
For some months past Mr. Klllmore had
: been , falling in health and those who
, knew him in the old days to possess a
j constitution of iron and unusual strength
noticed the transformation and were not
greatly surprised at death's easy victory.
Railroad men throughout the West and
others who had occasion to deal with
Mr. Fillmore will learn of his demise with
genuine sorrow. Already telegrams are.
coming in from prominent officials and
from old-time friends, expressing deep-
ilatildf who" recently '^diecf at;
Tubingen, aged 72, was one of the pioneers
in South Germany in . the movement for
securing greater privileges for women. .
The body of Charles Schneider w;iÂ»
found on Misslon-Btreet wharf No. 2 at
t>:cO o'clock yesterday mornlngr with a
bullet wound in the right temple and a
revolver lying near the right hand.; Cor
oner's Deputies Mike Brown and Jam* j

wharf, arriving at 7:15 o'clock. Brown had j
taken some letters and papers out of. the
dead mart's pocketÂ«Â«nd Murphy had taken
1.05?ession of the revolver when Police- {
men Frank Esola and Illghtower came t
alone- Hlghtowt r took the papers from.
Deputy Brown, and Esola relieved Mur
pliv of the revolver. They refused to al
low the deputies to take the body to the ;
Morgue, saying, that they were acting
under the order of Chief of Police Witt- j
man in cases where the police might sus
pect that a crime might have been.cpm
ni!tted. â¢ 'Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ '.
The deputies there_upon drove tho
wagon back to the Morgue and waited for
the police to conclude their examination
oi the body and its surroundings. At
live minutes before 10 o'clock a telephone
njessage was received at the Coroner's
office by Deputy Charles Meehan from
police neadquarters informing him that
the body might be removed^
"1 have no objection," said Coroner In
land, "to the police taking possession ot
all the evidence in a case like the pres
crit. which might have been a murder. It
is proper also that the body should not
be- disturbed until the detectives, arrive
to take note .of its > position ,and sur
roundings." . . * .

To his tact 'in the vast army

enjoyed. With 'the exception of the great
strike of 1894.* when' all' railways In the

with 3! the Huntington roads of over

During the great strike of 1894,' Mr. Fill

"Well, I'll be' ," repeated the
'tramp; "I wish I had your snap!"
One of the hardest working of railroad
men, Fillmore used to enjoy telling a
story of . a tramp who once envied his
"snap." It was one hot day during- an
Inspection trip. The train had been side
tracked at Slsson and Fillmore, sat alone
in the observation car, his' coat and vest
and collar off, fanning himself. A gang
of .tramps slouched- past, headed by one
known to the railroad men as "Arizona

ways an advocate of generosity toward
widows .and orphans of trainmen who died
at their posts.
His services In this capacity attracted
attention from other roads and he was
offered and accepted the superimendency
of construction for the Morris and Es
sex railroad and completed a double
track system from Phillipsburg to Dover.
Thence he came west, and was employed
by the Union Pacific on July 1, 1869, as
assistant division superintendent of the
Western division. This place he held for
more than two years, at the end of which
time his services were secured * by the
Central Pacific as assistant to Assistant
General Superintendent John Corning,
where he remained two'years.
In 1874 he was' made division superin
tendent, and in August, 1878, was trans
ferred to San Francisco as master of
transportation. Upon the death of Mr.
Fellows, In 18S0, Mr. Fillmore. was ap
pointed assistant general superintendent,
and in 1882, upon the promotion of A. N.
Towne to general manager, he was called
to fill the newly created position of gen
eral superintendent. Ten years later he
was made general manager of the Pacific
system of the Southern Pacific.

made unavoidable. The employes, from
master mechanics down to engine â¢wipers,
knew these things and loved him for hi>j
disposition toward them.
Mr. Fillmore was born In Onondaga
County, New York, April 5, 1815. He was
educated In the public schools and at
Casanova Seminary, then one or, the best
known institutions of learning in the
East. It had always I been his intention
to adopt railroading as his life work, and
at the conclusion of his studies he took
a place as brakeman on the Delaware and
Lackawanna railroad In order that/ he
might master the complete details of the
occupation. Six months later he was
made foreman of construction for the
same road, which was then building a
double track between "Washington, N. J.,
and Lehigh, Pa., and a year later was
promoted to the position of assistant su
perintendent of construction.

WASHINGTON, D. C. Febl 27.â Under
special order the Senate convened to-day
at 11:45 a. m., in aider that it might at
tend as a body the services in memory of
the late President William McKinley,
held in the hall of the House of Repre
sentatives at n o'clock. As soonjas the
body had been called to order Frpe, the
president pro tern., said that by his dir#>
tion on last Monday the clerk had not
called the names of the two Senators
from South Carolina, they being in con
tempt of the body. On Tuesday, he said,
he had directed the clerk to restore the
names to the roll in the event of a roll
call. He had done this, n.ot because he
,doubted the propriety of his action on
Monday, but because a very grave ques
Â¦ tion was involved, which lie desired to
submit to the Senate itself. ' Â£^- v'
Frye said that the Senator from Wash
ington (Turner) had taken an. appeal
from the decision of the chair on Mon
day, but amid the cloud of
points of order and objections
he (Frye) had overlooked and forgotten
the appeal and had proceeded with other
business. For his foxgetfulness he
Legged the pardon of the Senator from
Washington. Had he done such a thing;
willfully he said he never could have for
given himself.
Frye said he had received a letter from
the senior Senator from South Carolina
(Tillman), requesting that he be heard
on a question of highest ' privilege. The
chair could not entertain such a request
in these circumstances without the
unanimous consent of the Senate, but at
the proper timeâ perhaps to-morrowâ i
such a request might be entertained.
Turner called attention to the fact that ;
he had asked that the protest, of the '
senior Senator from South Carolina be
spread "upon the minutes. He had de
tired, he said, to insist upon this re
quest on Monday, but had been cut off by,
points of order and by a motion that the 1
Senate go into executive session. Since
that ttoe two adjournn*?nts of the Sen
ate had Interfered with the performance
of his duty. . â¢ , . ' .
Turner maintained that the? filing offi
cially of such protests wsls in
with the custom I of the British Parlla-.
ment and with the best parliamentary
practice of this country upon any ques
tion Involving a constitutional privilege.
"The Senator is right." said the chair
man, "and the protest will be spread
upon the minutes without objection.' '
It was so ordered.
Burrows of Michigan, chairman of the
Committee on Privileges and- Elections,
said that at the proper time an oppor
tunity â¢ might be afforded the senior
Senator from South. Carolina to make his
statement on privilege, but just now he
felt constrained to pbject-
Hoar suggested that the protest spread
upon the minutes be; referred to the Com
mittee on Privileges 1 and Elections.
"I have no objecttDns." said Turner.
Bacon of Georgia said it occurred to
him that the protest was not a matter
for further action by the Senate.' It cer
tainly was a question of too great im
portance to dispose of hastily.
Hoar contended that the protest was In
the nature of a petition, and ought there
fore to be referred to a- committee. Such
action was entirely respectful. He did not
insist upon his suggestion, however, ia
view of the doubt in Bacon's mind.
The Senate then, at 12:01 p. m., ad
journed until to-morrow.

LONDON, Feb. 27.â The Liberal Union
ists, at the annual meeting of the Liberal
Unionist council to-day, definitely, repudu
ated any desire to enroll themselves un
der Lord Rosebery's banner. The Duke
of Devonshire, lord president of the coun
cil, who presided, declared Lord Rose
bery had done great service in disasso
ciating himself from the pro-Boer ele
ment, but the speaker failed to see how
the Liberal imperialist party could offer
any inducements to the Unionists. Men
who refused to play the game and im-.
partially blamed others all around,
wheuier Kipling or Rosebery. would meet
with' very scant sympathy. The country
was not disposed to follow the_ flag of
statesmen who had quietly looked on
while these new guides of the Liberal
party had led it deeper and deeper into
the. mire. He sympathized with Lord
Rosebery's offer to reconstruct the party,
but did not expect his efforts would be
attended with success. In the meanwhile
he believed the Unionists would adhere to
their own party.
The resolutions passed by the meeting
referred to the occasionally expressed
hopes of the Roseberyites of getting
Unionists recruits and declared that their
hopes were quite groundless.

MADRID, Feb. v 27.â The .Foreign Minis
ter, the Duke of Almodovar, at the con
ferences the Senators yesterday,
announced that the ! Government was op
posed to the insertion of a clause in the
Spanish - American, treaty prohibiting
Americans from; acquiring land in Spain,
as Spaniards acquired property and stocks
In the United States.
The Minister decllne4 to promise to sub
mit a draft of thÂ« treaty to Parliament
before it was signed.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â Surprise is ex
pressed here at the report that the nego
tions for the Spanish-American treaty are
delayed owing to Spanish objections to the
provision for the holding ol lands by the
citizens of either country , in the other.
This point was discussed pretty thorough
ly some months ago ana Mr. Storer re
ported It satisfactorily adjusted. The
Spanish Government wished its citizens to
have the power to hold lands in the
United States on terms of equality with
American citizens, being willing In return
to allow â¢ similar privileges in Spain â¢ to
Americans. The difficulty in the way con
sisted, in certain United States statutes
prohibiting alien ownership of lands, par
ticularly in, the Territories and the Dis
trict of Columbia, This 'difficulty was re
moved -. finally, it was supposed, by the
agreement of the United States Govern
ment to give Spaniards, the most favored
nation treatment in this matter, which
.would, according to the common construc
tion of treaties, give them the same priv
ilege as American citizens . to hold- lands
and stocks. ;.Of course the new treaty will
have all the force of law and, under the
.Supreme -Court's decision. If it conflicts
with existing law upon any such point as
-alien ownership, of lands, then it super
sedes that law. >>; â¢ â¢

Bâ â â OWED beneath the burden of
four score arid. ten years, with a
dread malady sapping away his
__ remaining, vitality, the Rev. S.
D. Simonds, one of ihe most
widely known ministers of the Methodist
Episcopal church, is awaiting the final
call of the grim reaper under circum
stances that call for immediate investi
gation.
. The aged divine is living in the house
at 935 Clay street, that for thirty years
he called his home, but- which he Isold
four years ago -to Mrs. Helene Hartwig
sen, formerly a janitress in one of the
public schools, to whom he pays the sum
of $25 per' month for his board, room and
ffl T"fi p , , . - , - - i Â¦ .'Â«Â¦. â ' M. i*a *Â« W-â7 *~Â» -.
For some time "past" /the nelgKborslhTtTie"
vicinity of- 935 Clay â¢ street have discussed
the forlorn condition of the aged and
helpless minister. Rumors circulated
thick and fast that the old man had been
induced to part with his property for a
mere pittance, and that the woman who
had agreed to look, after him for the
short balance of his life was not giving
him the attention that he should have.
Stories were told --that friends of the
/old clergyman were denied admission to
the house and that he was kept locked up
during the day in a small cold room; in
the rear of the back yard- of the prem
ises. Until six months '-'ago .'the Rev.' Mr.
Simonds was seen â¢ frequently â¢ on , the
streets near the house he lived In, but<for
half a year his familiar, figure has been
missing. ,:"Â¦â¢- I".--:.- >..'Â¦ Â¦.
Faded From Public Sight, i .
Some of the f neighbors -who could -see
Into the back yard of $35 Clay, street le
1 cently declared that the aged clergyman
was in a pitiful "condition and '.though
they tried to secure â¢ admittance to 'Â¦ his
bouse could- not do so.l- Â¦ - â¢'â¢-Â¦; .-" -
Stranger still,, and yet more pitiful, -Is
the fact that the once brilliant minister
of the 'Methodist Episcopal church has
been allowed to drop out of, sight by his
brother divines and. in the last year none
of the men of the cloth has visited him to
cheer his declining- years or to see If he
needed any attention.
"Sans eyes, sans teeth, sans tasteâ sans
everything," in "the last stage that ends
this strange,* eventful history," with his
mindrctouded' by .the ..infirmity of age}
I Rev. Mr. Simonds Is, It is said, denied the
attention that he bargained for when he
sold his property to Mrs. Helene Hart-
I wigsen. . '

crossed electric light and telephone
wires caused great excitement in the
Mission early yesterday morning.and kept
the firemen busy for several hours Isieu
tenant Ellenberger of Truck Company 3
accidentally touched a "live" wire on a
pole at the corner of Valencia andTwen
ijvfourth streets and narrowly escaped
being electrocuted. The wire burned
through the glove he v.-as wearing and
gave him a shock that nearly threw him
from the pole to the pavement.
The first trouble with the wires occurred
about 2:15 o'clock yesterday morning at
the cornerof Twenty-fourth and Valencia
streets The "sub-station" on the pole
at that corner caught fire from the wire
used for lighting an electric lamp on the
crossing, in a very few minutes the "sta
tion was completely burned out and 100
telephone wires running through it were
put out of (service. The pole and the
cross arms above the station quickly
caught fire, and it was feared that Ure
wires would fall to the street. The tele
phone bells on the circuit clanged merrily
while the station was burning and awoke
tne patrons of the company from their
slumbers. TCotwIthstanding a heavy
cownfall of rain, many men and women
hurried to the scene of the fire find pa
tiently watched for the fall of the burn
ing potje. Policemen Casey and Prender
gast had in the meantime notified the
members of Engine Company ICo 13, situ
ated'on Valencia street, near Twenty-
Kixth, but they could do but little good.
They feared a shock if they directed a
stream on the burning pole, and devoted
most of their tune to watching the sparks
â¢which were flying in ali directions.
Truck Company Called.
The members of Truck Company 9 were
also called out on a still alarm. They
quickly threw up a ladder against' the
post, which was then burning fiercely,
and Lieutenant KUenberger wanted to try
what effect a chemical extinguisher would
have on the blaze. Ellenberger got a
footing on a piece of the platform that
had not been burned through and tried to
steady himself by catching a wire just
over his head. Unfortunately for him,
the wire selected was a "live" one, the
insulation having been burned off, and
quick as a flash the glove "he wore for
protection was burned through. The
shock benumbed Ellenberger's arm for a
time, but he gamely remained aloft. Cap
tain Banning: sent up Truckman Collins
to aid Ellenberger-, and after considerable
difficulty they succeeded in extinguishing
the burning pole and cross arms.
While the firemen were working at the :
first fire another pole on the corner of
Mission and Army streets was discov
ered on fire by Sergeant Wolff. Like the |
one on the corner of Valencia and Twen
ty-fourth streets, the "sub-station" and
cross arms were soon blazing fiercely.
Wolff ran to the house of engine 13 to
aiarm the members, and found that they
â¢were working at the fire two blocks
away. He hurried there and after noti
fying them of the second blaze ran back
to Army street, with Patrolman Young,
to keep the crowd that quickly gathered
from approacninR- the pole, as it was
momentarily expected that all of the
overhead -wires -would fall. The "sub--;
station'-' of the telephone company was
destroyed in a few minutes, and 200 more
telephones were put out of service. The
wire that caused the b'aze furnished cur
rent^fo.r the elecjric Jamps that. .are keuÂ£.

and the Mission road. .... . ,'â¢/-;., ,;Â¦;Â¦-â¢
Lights Are Put Out.
The lights went out and the neighbor
hood was in darkness save for the light
from the burning mass. The firemen,
profiting by their experience at the Valen
cia street fire, managed the Army-street
blaze like experts, and soon had it ex
tinguished.
The cornice of a two-story building on
the corner of Twenty-fifth and Valen
cia streets, occupied as a pharmacy and
dwelling by James H. Winter, next
claimed the attention of the firemen. Ah
electric light wire crossed the telephone
wires running into the drug store, and a
lively little blaze was started. The fire
men cut the telephone wire and soon had
the fire extinguished. By this tim.> they
were drenched through to the skin; as a
heavy rainstorm, accompanied by "\uite
a high wind,- was in progress. Just as
they -were preparing to return to their
houses another blaze was discovered on
the roof of a building on the opposite cor
ner. It was but the work of a moment
to extinguish it. During the remainder
of the morning hours a police and fire
patrol was kept in the neighborhood to
v.-&tch the wires, as it was feared that
they might start a few more fires.
The loss and Inconvenience to the tele
phone company is considerable. A force
of men was put at work at daybreak to
replace the burned stations and get the
lines In working order. They made con
siderable headway yesterday, but It will
be some little time before the system is
again in complete working order.

5 The | Board*- of : Education- held a . con
ference last - night for -the purpose of dis
cussing a- proposed amended ' plan for the
election :of ; new .teachers.. The^ four.' di
rectors, together with : Superintendent of
Schools Webster^ considered. the plan put
in operation last year,. which provides foi
the; appointment . of ; teachers . in one ?â¢ ol
three waysâ namely-^by \ oral and written
examinations *and - training school '. experi
enceâwith a view to ' improving it. While,
no 'conclusion was arrived at regarding
the adoption, of -a new- plan Sit was the
consensus . of r opinion ,\that , the old one
could be" modified in justice to applicants
for positions as teachers. '
As one important result of the confer
ence it. was decided that it is- absolutely
necessary -to have an. examination in the
near ; future for i. the election of at least
Jif ty additional teachers. President Den
man stated f that the eligible ; list- of fifty
formed by/ the last " board .was beins
rapidly decreased - owing to the resigna
Â¦ tions of regular, teachers and the estab
lishment of new glasses.-. .
There have been . twenty-seven new
teachers assigned to classes and the re>
malning twenty-three are kept constantly
at work as substitutes. In fact itis fre
quently necessary to call in -outside tutors
to relieve regular teachers. , .While no dato
was decided upon it is quite probable that
the first examination under the; new plan
yet -Â¦ to; be adopted -will be called in one
or two months,' probably, in April.-. *
Superintendent -Webster made a plea fbr
the transfer of some twelve teachers now
on the evening eligible list , to the day
eligible list. â¢- Webster was supported by
Director Woodward, but the other three
directors were not disposed to favor the
plan. \ Webster said that if -the transfers
were -made it would permit of the post
ponement of .the examination until next
July. In the meantime the board could
take its time, hi' agreeing- on the best
method of electing teachers., , .
- Webster, made a plea for a 'competitive
written examination, which he held is the
only <Â¦ way to remove , political influence
effectually; in. the -selection of -teachers.
His plan provides. that the papers of the
applicants shall; be exposed to the oublic
gaze for one or two months, so that eacn
applicant could see' that he or she was
being treated fairly. Five judges or ex
aminers would be selected, two by ''the
Board of i Education, two by a the School
Superintendent' and; one by., the four so
selected,, neither, to be in any way con
nected/with the school : department. Â¦>,
-Director Denman expressed himself in
favor ; of) a combination of the three
methods now. in; effect. When, the plan
was adopted last year Denman introduced
a'. resolution providing that certain cred
its be â¢ allowed . for oral Â¦< and ; wri tten ex
aminations \ and training . school experi
ence, but it was voted; down.,- .When the
matter comes to a vote Denman : will re- !
introduce the same resolution. Director
Mark is fin favor of the present plan as
being the ; best for the purpose, :while
Roncovieri wanted more time to consider
the various -plans presented. Another
conference will, be- held soon, when it is
expected tho ' board -wtll finally agree on
the plan to be adopted. ;'::.:

There was a large attendance at the
meeting , and the matter was considered
at Kreat length. Two months ago the as

point, but, the members gave it little con-,

either do away with the by-law or en
force it. . Last night's meeting was well
attended ' and the members held a warm

force , the by-law. In. future any one dis
obeying it will be expelled from the asso

Judge Lawler ordered the twelve men

being "rushed" in -giving a. legal .opinion

that the opinion will be, to the effect that
they (the Commissioners) had not the
right to employ substitutes.

threatened that he would see further into

state of anger and reminded Parry that
the board members were not given : to
branding each other as robbers. Commis
sioner Grady also made strenuous objec

"We are not robbers," declared Grady.
"Anyhow, this discussion is entirely out
of order, and I make the point of order,
Mr. Chairman."
"I really, don't, care If you do. object."
said. Parry to Watt. "I've said it and I'll
say it againâ we are robbing the substi
tutes." â¢ Â¦'.-. -
A fire of wrath broke out among the
Fire " Commissioners yesterday, and it
took all the efforts of Rolla V. Watt to
extinguish the sparks and cool the hot air
engendered - by Commissioner Parry, who
called upon the City Attorney to "hasten"
in submitting his opinion so far as it af
fects tho status of the substitutes of the
department. .. -.
For a time it* looked as If the board
was in imminent peril and would be cut
off from escape from the scorching, siz
zling criticism of Parry. He said: "I
have an opinion on this question aad i I
will, see whether this board shall con
tinue to rob the substitutes in the depart
ment of 35 cents a day."
At thia warm moment Commissioner
Watt climbed to the highest rung of the
ladder of indignation and clearly let
Parry know that the word "rob" was in

application. Â¦â¢. ; .

they had examined Mrs. Alma Keith last
November, after she had left the sanita
rium, and she was sane. M. E. Ccrf, Miss
Juliet Levy, Mrs. A. Harris, Miss Rosa

had never heard the Guggenheim parrot
make a noise. Miss Fannie Guggenheim
explained that her parrot was not noisy,
and she accounted for its shrieks Tues

that it had to imitate the noises made by
the crazy people next door.

The committee rejected a demand for $90
for a horse purchased by the* Police Com
mission, as no requisition was made on
the board for the animal.
The committee recommended that the
three-story brick building at the north
east corner ; of Commercial and Drumm
streets be rented for $175 per month for
use of the harbor police. The Police Com
mission recommended that the building be
secured, as the present police station is
unsanitary and ; inadequate for the pur
pose 'used. - Â¦ . Â¦
â¢The Supervisors' Police Committee met
yesterday and < reported in favor of the
application of the National Club for a
permit to hold a professional boxing con
test in March. In taking this action the
petitions of the Pacific Coast. Hayes Val
ley and Bay City athletic clubs were de
nied. , Supervisors Boxton and Eggera
voted In favor of the National Club, but
Curtis refused to Join his colleagues. Cur
tis advised "Joe" Goddard of the Na
tional Club not to pay the $1200 license un
til the board had taken action on the res
olution.
The committee granted permission to
the Bay City Athletic Club to hold an
amateur boxing exhibition on March 12.
but laid over for two weeks the petition
of- the San Francisco Athletic Club to
hold a professional contest in April and
tne Twentieth Centuryv Club for one in
May. .Â¦Â¦...
Eastern 1 Pumping 1 Machinery.
" Winn questioned Schussler at length
upon the practice of the company of buy
ing pumping machinery in the East, but
Schussler replied that the company, got
only such machinery in the East as could
hot be manufactured here.
"That's nonsense," said Winn. "You
can get any kind of machinery here."
"But we can't get it Just when we want
it," replied Schussler. smiling.
"You mean you'd ' rather go East than
patronize home industry."
"You're anxious to make a point on
me,' rejoined Schussler. coolly, "but ' 1
don't think you will make it stick."
The Point Lobos â¢ water - supply, which
was declared to be impure by the local
health authorities, was considered by the
board. Schussler said the water was not
bad, as reported, as was evidenced by
the fact that the Federal Government was
negotiating with the water company for
water to.be furnished to the Presidio re
servation.
"Wasn't that, Point Lobos water con-
"You will so advise the company?" in
quired thtr Mayor.
"Yes, sir," responded Kellogg. "I will
do si> because mat contract aeals with
property which' does not concern this
ooard. Were its . provisions to be pub
lished, it would be xatal to the projects of
the company." â¢ .
Braunnart moved that the company be
given until noon to-day to supply the
board with a copy of the. contract, and it
was so ordered.
D'Ancona suggested that the company
also supply the board with data as i to
the purjty of the water furnished to con
sumers here, and a motion to that effect
prevailed.
Referring again to the Suburban Com
pany's deeds, Braunhart asked what was
the amount paid for the Â¦ Alameda and
Calaveras properties. Schussler answered
that the properties, numbering 156 pieces,
cost $2,302,840 13. s
"What did you pay the Suburban Com
pany for water?" inquired Braunhart ol
Kellogg. . â¢
"The Spring Valley Company has never
paid a nickel. to the Suburban Company,"
answered the corporation attorney. -.
. "What was -the consideration. named in
the contract?" asked the Mayor.
"Mutual covenants embodied in the con
tract," was the guarded reply.
Finding it impossible to get satisfaction
on this line of inquiry, the members of the
board asked for specific information as
to the cost of new construction on the
Alameda system up to January 1, .1902.
Schussler said the cost was $765,213 31. He
went on to say that an 'item of $141,000 in
terest was inc'uded I in the company's
statement, because the board ' last year
failed to make allowance for that sum,
and as the stockholders were forced to
pay it to the bondholders. Schussler main
tained that the stockholders should be
reimbursed for the outlay.
Schussler maintained that the value of
the Spring Vallev Company's property
was (increasing efery year, jj Although it
produces 1 15.000,00(r gallons daily, he said
an txpendlture of about $6,000,000' would
increasefthe daily supply to 60,000,000 gal
lons of filtered water.
Must Furnish Contract To-Day.
Inquiry .was made as to the properties
included in the transfer,, but Schussler
said considerable of it was without the
jurisdiction of the board, as no rate there
on was asked by. the company.
Supervisor Winn stated that Schussler
was evading the spirit of the resolution
of the board, which made a demand upon
the company to furnish specific informa
tion.
The resolution in question was read and
Schussler was asked if he would furnish
the board with a copy of the articles of'
incorporation of the Suburban Company.
HV answered in the affirmative and was
then asked if he would furnish a copy of
the contract.
Attorney Kellogg answered for Schuss
ler, saying that this promise could not be
made. He believed the company would
not furnish the document, as it was his
intention to advise them not to do so.
Sitting as a committee of. the whole, the
Board of Supervisors yesterday resumed
its inquiry into . the valuation of the
Spring Valley Water Company's plant,
with a view toward fixing water rates for
the current year.
Engineer Herman Schussler of the water
company occupied | the stand throughout
the day and answered all questions rela
tive to values with characteristic readi
ness! Supervisor Connor presided, â¢ and
Mayor Schmltz and Supervisors Braunhart
and Brandenstein conducted the inquiry.
Schussler filed a statement of the cost
of the Alameda Creek system, above
Riles,; which was independent of the City
Engineer's valuation of the company's
property. Schussler stated that the prop
erties which had heretofore been held in
trust by the Suburban Water Company
had been turned over to the Spring Val
ley Company. . ; r -
"Have deeds been made?" inquired
Braunhart in surprise. .
"The transfer was made this morning,"
replied Schussler, "and I am authorized to
state that the deeds will be made immed
iately."
The police were notified and the man
was searched and taken to the Receiving-

consolidation, and with these two examples as
â¢ t beets rumors of many other absorptions and
I consolidations of minor railroads received
ready credence. There was a resumption of
Tuesday's rise in Brooklyn Transit on buying
attributed to inside Interest, but without ex
planation. Chesapeake and Ohio and Norfolk
end Western were lifted on the reports of the
extraordinary de"tnaiid for bituminous coal.
There was rupport from tÂ»eide sources for Mis
souri Pacific, but the large liquidation con
tinued in that stock, supposed to be the result
of the recent death of a large holder. An-al-*a
meted Copper and Tennessee Coal vere active
but irregular, but both of these stocks ended
the day unchanged. The market, as a whole,
continues eluggleh and neglected. The dubious
condition in which the Northern Securities
Compsny is kÂ»>pt by the pending litigation
fccalntt it and the uncertainties of the money
outlook are amply sufficient to account for this
: tatÂ«. of affairs. ThÂ« consultations now going
â¢>n between those interested in the Northern
Securities Company and the fact that some of
the l/tr.k* are inclined to question the offerings
of Northern Securities stock as collateral ac
'â¢ount for this feeling. The export to-day of
SS.&00.000 in gold afforded no apparent relief
to the exchange market, indicating that the
gold went to meet maturing obligations abroad
artf that exchange bills were sold against it.

rather better known to the average rpeculator
than those which have occupied the broadest
attention for several days, but the obscure
specialties etlll had a. large part in the market,
particularly in the width of their price move
ments. Some new ones were brought forward
:nto activity to-day and were pushed smartly
upward and advances conttnued in some others
recently awakejied into activity. Stilt others
reflected' the passing of the speculative move
ment and the taking of ! pronts, after which
support was withdrawn and the market allowed
to take Its own course. The very larfe and
â¢>ereistent buying of Colorado and Southern
gives color to the rumors that control of the
road is sought. The admission of Chicago and

Chicago Grain Market. :
CHICAGO, FÂ«b. 27.â Corn strength was the
dominating factor-in grain speculation to-day/
It' started out somewhat better than at yester
day's close, influenced by firm- cables.^'. The
crowd, however, took the selling side early; and
an easy feeling was manifested for"a- time.'
The local selling was offset by a fair commis
sion house demand, the Southwest buying lib-'
erally and professionals later came in the mar
ket with bull Intentions. As prices advanced
shorts were forced to cover and a good trade
developed. The strength at Kansas City and
St. Louis did much to help bull sentiment here
Predictions of storms In the Southwest also
was a bull factor. Late in the day profit-tak
ing caused a loss of much of the strength,
though May closed firm, %o higher at-6l%c.
Wheat" had only the corn bulge to help in' a
struggle against numerous bearish . tendencies.
Cables started slightly higher but at no time
reflected yesterday's local strength. North
western and primary receipts were increased
and the' crowd took the selling side. May
opened %@"4c to Yi@%c lower at 76%@76%o,
and eased to 76%c. Then the corn influence be
gan to help, the outsiders bought and manifest
ed a desire to play the market. May sold up
to 77 'fee. but the late liquidation in corn start
ed the local crowd to hammering the market
again and prices slid off. May closed weak,
%Â®V*c lower at 769ic.
Commission houses took hold of oats early
and bid the price of May to 44c. There was
fair buying of corn, which exerted some influ
ence., but near the close May was offered quite
freely and the strength was lost. - May closed
steady, a shade higher at 43%c. . .
Provisions -were fairly active and maintained
a good strength all during the session. The
start was slightly lower, influenced by heavy
receipts at the yards and consequent lower
prices for hogs. Covering on the grain ad
vance and some small buying advanced all
frovisions and May pork closnd 7 Vic up to
15 25. May lard. 10c higher at $9 30. and

Tlic English Salmon Market
Tbe London Grocers" Gazette of February Â¦
esr? of the salmon situation: "The market
i^rainues very firm or. the spot, but transac
tions are limited by the absence of supplies.
Pome idea, of the 'small compass into which
spot stocks have been reduced will be gathered
*rom the returns of the Liverpool public ware
houses, which show that on January 31 stocks
Bret* less than two-thirds of those on the same
day last year, while the deliveries during the
month of January from these warehouses were
lust double those o" January last ycar.^ Al
thouph no figure? are procurable regarding the
London stocks and deliveries it is reasonable tu
suppose that they have followed a similar
course to thoso of Uvcrpooi. Spot prices are
Mm considerablj- above those to arrive. Choice
tafia and flat:- are In very small compass.
Uuyerf, consequently, are directing^ their at
tention to arrival goods."

NEW YORK, Feb. 27.-^The Commercial AS
vcrtlscr's London financial cablegram says :
Attention on the 'Stock Exchange was ab
sorbed in the settlement and there j was con
siderable anxiety lest difficulties might be en
countered in the Kaffir declaration, but noth
ing happened' but ' scattered . liquidation. "At
tendance on ths floor was thin to-day and
business was practically nil. American smelt
ers were skylarking mest of the time and the
leading arbitrateuis to the dealinsB were five
Wabash bonds and 430 shares ot stock. Money
ruled steady. . â¢
The return cf the Bank of England shows a
marked borrowing of Â£3,250.000. The revenue
collection amounts to Â£250,000. There is not
likely to be any market freedom until the April
dividends, as the market debt to the . bank
amounts to Â£S,0O0,O00. which even Government
disbursements can hardly liquidate. -:.:Â¦,,

1 Kisses come high' on Fourth street. At

who keeps a bakery on that highway.
He paid $200 yesterday â¢ for one he stole
from Miss Adella ' Nelson,; the- pretty
young . lady who, : up ' to the , time . of Kohs*
theft, helped him in the bakeshop. Â¦
Miss Nelson valued a smack from ' her
pouting lips at $5000, but is content to "re
ceive the $200. ; ".'â¢;Â¦. ! .
.Miss Nelson brought a suit for : $5000
damages and $75 ' medical fees; against
Kohs. last March. She said that, while at
work in the kitchenof Kohs' bakery, the
proprietor sneaked \ up behind , r her,'- and,"
putting his arms about her waist _ and
without as much 'as saying ."by your
leave," pressed his lips to hers., -â¢; This
bold. thief t shocked the young lady ; into
nervous prostration, from which she did
not recover until^ she had spent thirty
days in bed and paid a doctor $75. &.
She brooded -over the Insult for a:- year
and then brought suit against Kohs. The
case was " heard in Judge Hunt's court,
but the jury failed to agree on, a verdict,
and Miss Nelson despaired of getting;re
dress.; : '- ! .. ; " ';Â¦'Â¦- "--'Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦. â''Â¦"Â¦Â¦â¢: 'â¢'Â¦ '".:- :

After a very peculiar inquest yesterday
into the cause of the death of Robert' B.
Milroy the Coroner's jury returned a ver
dict that Mr. Milroy came to his death on
February 18 at St. Luke's Hospital from
the result of injuries received in failing
from a Haight street car on February 1
opposite Montgomery street. ;
There were profuse apologies to the Cor
oner for not informing him of Mr. Jlil
roy's death and for neglecting to notify
Dt. Bacigalupi, the Coroner's surgeon, of
the fact that a private autopsy was to be
made. The autopsy was conducted by Dr.
Armisted and several invited friends of
the medical fraternity, the . Coroner and
bis - autopsy surgeon being uninvited and
kept in the dark as to what was going
on. It developed at the inquest that Dr.
Armisted began the autopsy at the knee,
which, in the Coroner's opinion, was a
blunder calculated to cloud the cause of
death. Dr. Armisted told the resident
physician at St. Luke's and the under
taker that he would notify the Coroner,
but failed to do bo, when such notification
could be made directly % by telephone to
the Coroner's office. When the Coroner
ordered the funeral delayed until he could
eummon a jury_to view the remains Dr.
Bacigalupi repaired to the home of the
dead man, and found that the private
autopsy had destroyed all the evidence as
to the cause of death.
Was Unable to Explain.
Dr. Armlsted went on the witness stand
and was unable ' to explain why he had
concealed the case from the Coroner. He
tsaid that he had telephoned to Dr. Ice
land's private office and had been in
formed that that gentleman in his official
character as Coroner was engaged in his
official office in holding the inquest in the
Nora Fuller case. He. admitted that he
had not attempted to telephone â¢ to Â¦ the
Coroner's office, â¢ where that official and
his deputies were. Â¦ r
From. the trend of the questions asked
by Frank P: Kelly, attorney for, the rail
road company. . it , was apparent that . the
contention will be. made,- should suit, re
sult, thatMr. Milroy was stricken.' with 'a
fit of apoplexy as he was boarding / the
car and fell backward into the street Â¦ i
Conductor S. T. Johnson testified that
Mr. Milroy and hl6 companion, Thomas
Mulqueen, stopped the car Jn-front of the
Crocker building-. Mr. Milroy stood on the
lower steps of the back platform, grasp-
Ing a stanchion with his right hand and
holding on to the upper frame of the
dashboard with his left hand' As the car
started Mr, Milroy let go with both hands
and fell into the street on his. back.' . .
Contradicts Conductor.
Thomas Mulqueen* flatly contradicted
the testimony given -by the conductor. He
ewore that the conductor, never took hl3
hand off the bell strap from .the ' time I he
stopped the -car. until he started It again
Mr. Milroy had hold of the dashboard
â¢with his left hand and had placed his left
foot on the lower step when the car start
ed and threw him off. The conductor did
not give him time to get on. ;â¢â¢--Â¦. â¢
Coroner Iceland, as a deterrent to the
medical men. read the following ordinance
of the Supervisors;
Order No. 2709â Section I. It shall be un
lawful for any . persc/n . to perform or assist in
performing any auwpsy or other post-mortem

Â¦ An Ellis : street ; car -crashed into a car
of the San Mateo line at . Fourth; ana
Bryant' streets last night at 10 o'clock
and three", women â¢ passengers received
painful injuries. The Ellis street car .was
going * at. slow 'Â¦. speed .- and did but littles
damage to the San ; Mateo car, breaking
one -window and a few . panels of .wood
Its front* was caught by the rear Â¦ step
of- the San Mateo car ana it was dragged
entirely off the track. '} The Â¦ Fourth street
line '.was Â¦ blocked for " half an hour until
the car; was dragged back upon the line
and hauled away, badly wrecked, to the
carhouse. : ,*;:, - .
â¢â¢ The > failure of the. San Mateo carmen
to understand - or, to observe the rules 01
tne roads was the cause of the accident.
J. C. Hammerberg, the motorman of the
iniis street car, .No. 573, says he saw the
other : car, but as , he has the right ol
way he expected it ; to ; stop until ' he - had
crossed its track. Apparently - the other
motorman: thought he- had â¢ time Â¦> to , cut
across ; In * front of Â¦ the Ellis street car
and made a dash forward Just in. time to
get in collision. His car is equipped with
an electric: brake, while the old-style
brake is on the : Ellis street ; car Â¦ and its
motorman Â¦ Â¦was not ' able to stop within
the Â£ ttf teen ?; feet â¢ which : he was distant
when he saw th,e danger.
V Hammerberg 'was placed under arrest
on a charg% of battery, preferred by Pa.
trolman -.Thomas F. Flynn, as^a.precau
tionary measure in ' case . the injuries ot
any. of the passengers should prove fatal.
His .conductor ! was \ C Smith. F.~ "W.
Shiner ; was , conductor of the San Mateo
car, No. 62,' and Martin Peterson was mo
torman. c - Both Peterson and Shiner re
fused to make any statement. \
Â¦';; Miss : J. : Blumenthal ; of 1014 - Hampshire
street was, the, only passenger on the Ellis
street car,- which was ; southward bound.
She .was thrown off' and badly bruised,
but at f the â¢ Emergency Hospital her in
juries were found not to toe serious. :
Mrs. Mary McKiernan and Mrs. "William
Kiley of . 204% East street, , slstera-in-law
were thrown from 'Â¦ the rear outside . seat
of .the ; San, Mateo car. Mrs. - McKiernan,
who ; is elderly, had her back badly hurt.
She was suffering intensely when taken
home. Mrs. Kiley was . only slightly
bruised.;^* ..Â¦.-
